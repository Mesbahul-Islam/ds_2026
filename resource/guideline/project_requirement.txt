Build a distributed 5G IoT gateway that aggregates and processes sensor data from thousands of IoT devices. 
Incorporate Edge ML\LLM to make real-time predictions (e.g., anomaly detection) close to the source.

Key Increments (6-Week Outline): 
1. Introduction: Simple IoT gateway collecting sensor data, storing it in a single node.
2. Communication: Add MQTT or CoAP for device-to-gateway communication; REST/gRPC for gateway-to-cloud.
3. Time & Consensus: Coordinate edge nodes with consistent configuration (e.g., over-the-air updates).
4. Performance & Scalability: Load balancing for incoming IoT data streams and auto-scale gateways.
5. Replication & Consistency: Edge gateway cluster replicates sensor data with eventual consistency.
6. Resource Scheduling: Distribute ML inference tasks among edge gateways and central cloud.
7. System Architecture:  Microservices for device management, data ingestion, ML inference, and coordination.
8. Middleware: Manage authentication, device provisioning, and logging in one layer.
9. Datacenter & Cloud: Run batch analytics and heavier ML training in a telco cloud environment.
10. Big Data Processing: Implement MapReduce/Spark to handle large historical sensor datasets.
11. Distributed ML:  Real-time anomaly detection model at the edge, updated from cloud training.
12. Edge–Cloud Continuum: Adaptive scheduling so immediate analytics run at the edge, while deeper insights come from the cloud.
